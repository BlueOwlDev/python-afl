python-afl (0.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Implement persistent mode.
  * Don't rely on the Python hash() function for computing code location
    identifiers.
  * Don't set PYTHONHASHSEED in py-afl-fuzz.
  * Remove the py-afl-showmap command.
    afl-showmap proper can be now used for Python code.
  * Remove the AflError class. It was only used for checking PYTHONHASHSEED.
  * Run Cython only in those setup.py commands that actually build extensions.
  * Implement a small test suite.

python-afl (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically disable instrumentation when the -n option is provided.
    Setting the PYTHON_AFL_DUMB environment variable is no longer needed.
    Thanks to Michal Zalewski for the hint how to implement this feature.
  * Update the module description to stress that it's dedicated for
    pure-Python code.
